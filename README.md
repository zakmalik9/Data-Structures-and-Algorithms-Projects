# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Projects

These are the 3 assignments and project I completed as part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python) Certification by Jovian in August 2023.

This certification gives an introduction to common data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, graphs) and algorithms (search, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming) in Python. 

Along with the assignments and projects, I solved many coding problems on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/zakmalik9/).

My certificate can be found on this [link](https://jovian.com/certificate/MFQTQOBXGE).
